Virtual Drum Circle

This project originated circa 2007 with the intent of creating a system by which individuals could participate in a virtual drum circle in an MRI scanner, tapping along bi-manually to various accompanying loops, with the scanner pinging sounds constituting one of the metric levels. Various Max/MSP patches were created in support of these efforts, including a Groove Sequencer, first written by Peter Keller during a research visit to the lab, and an Experiment Manager, largely written by Joe Saavedra, an undergraduate in the lab. The documentation below was pulled from the Janata Lab wiki pages. Running the experiments requires various external hardware, but the core capabilities of the Groove Sequencer and Experiment Manager are not dependent on it.
